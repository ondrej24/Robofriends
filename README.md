# Robofriends

This Robofriends project is one of my first experience with React.

The app uses JSONplaceholder and Robohash API to create and display unique robots.
The app is fully responsive and adapts to different screen sizes.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
